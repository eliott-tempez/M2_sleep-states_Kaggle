# Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States - Kaggle Competition

Sleep is crucial in regulating mood, emotions, and behavior in individuals of all ages, particularly children. By accurately detecting periods of sleep and wakefulness from wrist-worn accelerometer data, researchers can better understand sleep patterns and disturbances in children. The successful predictions would have significant implications for children and youth, especially those with mood and behavior difficulties.
